This is the modded QDLink which allows all apps to be mirrored to Proton Car's IHU regardless of state of handbrake. 
We decided to release this to public since someone is trying to make a fortune out of other's work. 
At the moment, only Android version available. 

1. Download modded QDLink [here](https://github.com/xeon1989/QDLink-Unlocked/raw/main/QDLink_1.5.9_FULL%20UNLOCK.apk). 
2. Transfer the apk file to your phone and open it with File Explorer, then install it.

Alternatively, you may copy the above link, then download and open from your mobile.
